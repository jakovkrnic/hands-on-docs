# Contributing

Our primary support channel is the forums at: https://github.com/jakovkrnic/hands-on-docs

Please file any bugs, issues, or feature requests using the GitHub issue system.
We are very welcoming of source code contributions in form of GitHub pull requests.

If you are looking for things to help out with, we have marked some issues with
the label "good first issue" to indicate that a fix will be fairly easy to produce
by someone less experienced with internals of the software.
